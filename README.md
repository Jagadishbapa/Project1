Anything that doesn't work:


Grade

Final grade: 3/10

## Main requirement was not met

Your app doesn't show the greeting with the user's name, nor has the necessary code for doing it: **(-5)**

I see you are displaying the text "Hello" just above the TextField, but you are not showing something like "Hello Andrea". The intent of *Program #1* was to see how you read the contents of an EditText and put that into a TextField, but here the TextField contains a fixed text.

## Other unmet requirements:

As your fragment is being added to the main activity in the XML, not in your code, this requirement is not met:
* The main activity will also create and display the fragment (The fragment CAN NOT loaded from in the xml) **(-1)**

The name is not being logged in the fragment, just in the main activity, so this requirement is not met:
*  log the name in the fragment and in activity **(-1)**
